------------------ logical contradictions in instruction files ------------------

@ multilple files:
    -section 2.3 states "you can use functions implemented only in spkmeans.c"
    -but earlier instruction says we can create more .c files

@ convergence: when checking if smaller than epsilon, should we 
                use absolute value on the difference or not?

@ iterating on all matrix VS iteration on top "triangle" - argue later

------------------------------- TODO - IMPORTANT ---------------------------------

@ is k=1 invalid for ALL goals, or just spk? (we asked in forum)

@ we need to create a header file + compilation shel script

@ output: make sure there's only 1 empty line at the end, not 2

@ remove "ex2_read_args" ?

@ line 242 (get_clusters) - handle division by zero properly

@ all matrices output - rami said "-0.0000" should be "0.0000" (NO NEGATIVES)
    - follow updates on forum thread! There's a chance they'll take it back (view almog's comment)

@ C functions that are exposed to the API --> return 1, instead of return NULL

@ instead of creating D_nhalf , just perform calculations based on D

@ last function in the part of api declerations (very last func in code)
    1. return 1 instead of return NULL  
    2. an error has occurred

@ determine_k loop: the loop should stop at k < floor(n/2):
    - the loop should INCLUDE the 'floor(n/2)' round (but we use '<')
    - after discussion, we realized it was wrong to subtract 1 inside floor,
        as well as outside

@ jacobi input - check for final answer in forum

@ make sure every line is below 80 characters long

@ before submission, make sure we didnt ruin anything in testing
    - check that output has ONLY one extra line
    - remove debug prints everywhere
