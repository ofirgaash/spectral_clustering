------------------ logical contradictions in instruction files ------------------

@ multilple files:
    -section 2.3 states "you can use functions implemented only in spkmeans.c"
    -but earlier instruction says we can create more .c files

@ convergence: when checking if smaller than epsilon, should we 
                use absolute value on the difference or not?

@ iterating on all matrix VS iteration on top "triangle" - argue later

------------------------------- TODO - IMPORTANT ---------------------------------

@ look over things we left in whatsapp group to do next time

@ we need a main function for C code (?)
    and then, make sure the file compiles using the command from instruction

@ fix argument handling when goal != spk

@ we need to create a header file + compilation shel script

@ all matrices output - rami said "-0.0000" should be "0.0000" (NO NEGATIVES)
    - follow updates on forum thread! There's a chance they'll take it back (view almog's comment)

@ jacobi input - check for final answer in forum

@ compare ourselves with updated script from leah

@ decide if we want to make our own specific tests

------------------------------- DO BEFORE SUBMISSION ------------------------------

@ go over forum again!  (might take A LOT OF TIME)

@ make sure every line is below 80 characters long

@ finish documentation: write a summary for every function

@ make sure we didnt ruin anything in testing
    - check that output has ONLY one extra line
    - remove debug prints everywhere
