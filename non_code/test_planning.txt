fixed test cases to run on every file:

- general input files
    d = 1

- general cases
    k = 1  (on all cases or in spk?)
    k >= N
    k = 0  (on all cases or in spk? almog&leah allowed on all cases)
    k as float value
    k as negative int
    k as negative float
    k as NaN

    filename that does not exist
    filename with wrong extention

    wrong order of arguments

    missing an argument

    # we can assume file is in correct format


- wam
    maybe: k=1, k=0
    make sure it works with positive k

- ddg

    make sure it works with positive k

- lnorm
    make sure it works with positive k

- jacobi
    make sure it works with positive k
