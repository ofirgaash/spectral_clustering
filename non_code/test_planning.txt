fixed test cases to run on every file:

- INVALID cases for SPK  (only for python)

    k = 1  
            if given as input:      invalid input                
            if given by heuristic:  an error has occurred    
    k >= N                                                  
    k = 0.0                                                   
    k as float value                                        
    k as negative int                                       
    k as negative float                                     
    k as NaN                                                


- general input files  (both python and C)

    d = 1  (Leah's tester contains this case)
    N = 1

    filename that does not exist
    filename with wrong extention

    wrong order of arguments
    missing an argument
