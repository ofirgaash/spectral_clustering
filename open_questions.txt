@ what to do with K, if the specified goal does not requires K?





------------------ logical contradictions in instruction files ------------------

@ multilple files:
    -section 2.3 states "you can use functions implemented only in spkmeans.c"
    -but earlier instruction says we can create more .c files


@ where to read args and file?
    -both Python and C instructions say to read goal & file_name
    -in the forum, rami said to read input ONLY in Python
    -https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=66417


@ arguments to C api functions
    -section 2.2 states the arguments to read from the C code
    -section 2.3 states we can decide which args to send/receive from API functions
    WHAT IS THE POINT OF SECTION 2.2 ???

@ edges in graph
    -section 1.1.1 says "only if Wij > 0, we define an edge between i,j"
    -but the formula fora Wij ALWAYS returns a positive number
    -eventually, after reading line 3 of 1.1.1, we concluded they know its always positive...



------------------------------- TODO - IMPORTANT ---------------------------------

@ bug in exercise 2 - read_input:
    if read_input fails at memory allocation *mid-operation*, 
    it does not free the memory that it did allocate before the failure.


@ reuse new generic code instead of exercise 2 old code, wherever we see fit.
    -matrix malloc
    -conversion from matrix to python-obj
