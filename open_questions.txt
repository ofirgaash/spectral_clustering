------------------ logical contradictions in instruction files ------------------

@ multilple files:
    -section 2.3 states "you can use functions implemented only in spkmeans.c"
    -but earlier instruction says we can create more .c files

@ convergence: when checking if smaller than epsilon, should we 
                use absolute value on the difference or not?

@ iterating on all matrix VS iteration on top "triangle" - argue later

------------------------------- TODO - IMPORTANT ---------------------------------

@ reuse new generic code instead of exercise 2 old code, wherever we see fit.
    -matrix malloc
    -conversion from matrix to python-obj

@ malloc day !

    @ left-overs to fi from ex2:
        -change do-work's name
        -take into account do-work's return value !!!!!

    -make sure we always free stuff after the function ends
    -make sure we always free stuff if allocation failed mid-way
    -There's something we didn't account for:
        when a function mallocs 2 (or more) matrices,
        if the failure is in the 'n'th matrix,
        we need to free matrices 1,...,(n-1) before exiting!

    @ bug in exercise 2 - read_input:
    if read_input fails at memory allocation *mid-operation*, 
    it does not free the memory that it did allocate before the failure.

@ output: make sure there's only 1 empty line at the end, not 2
